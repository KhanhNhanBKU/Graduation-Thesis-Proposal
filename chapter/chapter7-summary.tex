\chapter{Summary}

This thesis applies image processing and artificial intelligence, whose purposes are to research and build a system that can translate sign language into Vietnamese using only a camera module and a smartphone.

So far, a sign language translating system has been a massive challenge to many scientists and engineers because of the complexity of sign language and the diversity of the way people use it around the world. Moreover, when we researched and built the system, there were a few similar systems, but they only translated the sign language alphabet.

In addition, talking about human values, this system can resolve the lack of sign-language translators in Vietnam. It, indeed, means that people having disabilities will have the chance to live, work and communicate like those who do not. They can have a better education as the teacher can understand their thoughts and connect more efficiently. They can have better health as the health force has the chance to know more about how they are, what they feel, which means we can provide them a better treatment for their problem. Their life will be easier as the surrounding people can get them and talk to them more clearly.

The deaf and mute are also a part of this world, a part of us, not apart from us. Therefore, we firmly believe the deaf and mute deserve to have the chance to speak up, be heard, be seen, and be acknowledged. With this application, we people can know each other and communicate fluently regardless of our level of knowledge of sign language. Ultimately, our bonds will grow more vital and more profound, which will lead to a better world for the entire human race.

Those human values emphasize the importance of this project in our world. Besides, the promising solution we presented throughout this proposal means it is possible to translate sign language with the current technologies. In the upcoming time, we have more resources to dedicate our time to completing our algorithm, which results in the higher accuracy of the translation process and completing the thesis thoroughly.
