\section{Problem statement}

% TODO: Recheck problem statement

TLDR: It is hard for the deaf and mute to communicate with normal people. And there is not many ways for them to express their thought.

“Each deaf person is a separate world, and they feel more self-deprecating and alone when they do not interact and share with others. They still have the desire to contribute to society”, said Mr. Do Hoang Thai Anh, Vice Chairman of the Hanoi Deaf Association.

Language is a universal key that not only connects people but also builds up our society. Any disability that affects the ability to communicate is a significant disadvantage, especially for people with disabilities. They cannot integrate, have fun, learn, and communicate like ordinary people because they cannot express their thoughts, ideas, and desires to develop society as we do. That burden usually makes them fall into poverty, live a dependent life, and be exploited, apart from society. Hence, it is challenging for them to have beautiful lives.

In 2020, Vietnam had more than 2.5 million people who are deaf and mute, yet, only a tiny portion of them took part in education, had the chance to be understood, and integrated with society.

According to UNICEF, “Households with members with disabilities are often poorer, children with disabilities are at risk of having less education than their peers, and employment opportunities for people with disabilities are also lower than those without disabilities. Even though people with disabilities are beneficiaries of the policy, and poverty is not a burden to accessing health facilities, very few people with disabilities (2.3\%) have access to functional rehabilitation services when being sick or injured. Besides, there still exist inequalities in living standards and social participation for people with disabilities [6]. Many organizations are founded to support, help, and create better living conditions for people with disabilities to develop. However, this work still has many difficulties and inadequacies as there is no formal school or class. Moreover, there is no specific profession for this group of people, and the number of translators who know sign language is insufficient, while they take an essential role in helping the people with disabilities connect with society.

A quote from Cavett Robert, “Life is a grindstone, and whether it grinds you down or polishes you up is for you and you alone to decide.” However, it is challenging for these people to go to school and have an excellent education. They have their desires and dreams, but our resources and efforts are not enough to make them a polished grindstone. Furthermore, sign language shares the same property as any other spoken language; each different region and territory has a different way of expressing sign language. These unseen differences make communication, self-expression, and information exchange even more complex and challenging for humanity.

In short, we must admit that understanding and breaking the language barrier is extremely necessary and urgent because the deaf and mute, like many other ordinary people, deserve to be assisted, understood, and acknowledged. Furthermore, we believe our system is the resolve to problems of the deaf and hard of hearing.

\section{Goals}

% TODO: Write Goals

TLDR: It is crucial to find out a way that help we connect more easily, the deaf and mute can convey their thoughts much comfortably.
