Nowadays, research works related to the problem of converting sign language into text 
have been proposed by many researchers from all over the world, from many different 
approaches and perspectives.

“Hand talk-a sign language recognition based on
accelerometer and semi data” this paper introduces American
Sign Language conventions. It is part of the “deaf culture” and
includes its own system of puns, inside jokes, etc. It is very
difficult to understand understanding someone speaking
Japanese by English speaker. The sign language of Sweden is
very difficult to understand by the speaker of ASL. ASL
consists of approximately 6000 gestures of common words
with spelling using finger used to communicate obscure words
or proper nouns.

“Hand gesture recognition and voice conversion system for
dumb people” proposed lower the communication gap
between the mute community and additionally the standard
world. The projected methodology interprets language into
speech. The system overcomes the necessary time difficulties
of dumb people and improves their manner. Compared with
existing system the projected arrangement is simple as well as
compact and is possible to carry to any places. This system
converts the language in associate text into voice that's well
explicable by blind and ancient people. The language
interprets into some text kind displayed on the digital display
screen, to facilitate the deaf people likewise. In world
applications, this system is helpful for deaf and dumb of us
those cannot communicate with ancient person.

In which, two main approaches can be mentioned as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Glove based approaches:
  With this approach, it requires deaf and mute people to wearing a sensor glove. When user
  has any different action or gesture, these sensor will be recorded. After that, data from
  sensor will analyze by analyzer component and return the output for user.
  \item Vision based approaches:
  With this approach, image processing algorithms will be applied to be able to determine
  hand position, gestures and movements of the hand. The user will not have to wear necessary
  equipment like glove based approaches, which is convenient for user. However, with using
  library or algorithms of image processing, we need to deal with worst quality output, which is
  greatly affected by this algorithms.
\end{itemize}

With both approaches above, there is has some problems, that is, they can only recognize 
a very small number of words. These words are mostly words with different hand shapes 
that can be classified like that. However, in sign language, there will be many words 
that use the same hand shape but will differ in many characteristics, such as position 
and orientation. To our knowledge, there is currently no model that can handle the 
conversion of sign language flexibly and conveniently for the deaf-mute, helping them 
to communicate effectively. natural to the common man. Therefore, by applying appropriate 
technologies, the authors carry out this graduation thesis with the goal of breaking down 
the barriers between deaf-mute people and normal people, helping them to become self-sufficient. 
more confident in daily communication.
